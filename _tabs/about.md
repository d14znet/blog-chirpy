Hello World!

I'm a newbie IT sysadmin interested in **Unix systems, networking, server infrastructure deployment & automatization** and DIY projects.

In this blog I want to **document my personal projects** - and I might as well upload the **theory content** I gathered during the past years about networking, server infrastructure and other IT things (whenever I find the time to tidy them up nicely).

Everything is pretty much still **work in progress**. The main purpose of this blog is to collect documentation about the topics I mentioned, but if my How-Tos and notes might help someone with their own projects, I'll be more than happy.

Have fun reading!
